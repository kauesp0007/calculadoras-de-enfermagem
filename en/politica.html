                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">1. Introduction and Global Commitment to Privacy</h2>
                <p><strong>Nursing Calculators</strong> ("we," "our") is deeply committed to protecting the privacy and security of its users' data worldwide. This Global Privacy Policy has been developed to provide a clear, comprehensive, and transparent explanation of what personal data we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your information. Our practices are aligned with the highest data protection standards, including the European Union's <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>, Brazil's <strong>General Data Protection Law (LGPD)</strong>, and United States state laws, such as the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA)</strong>.</p>
                
                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">2. Identification of the Data Controller</h2>
                <p>For the purposes of applicable data protection legislation, the entity responsible for processing your personal data (the "Data Controller") is:</p>
                <p><strong>Entity:</strong> Ciadeenfermagem<br>
                <strong>Email for Privacy Matters (DPO):</strong> ciadeenfermagem@gmail.com</p>
                
                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">3. Detailed Analysis on the Use of Cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that websites store in your browser to remember information about your visit. They are essential for the functionality of the modern web, enabling everything from maintaining a login session to personalizing content and advertising. On our site, we use cookies to ensure a secure, functional, and relevant user experience. Below, we detail the categories of cookies we use:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies (Essential):</strong> These cookies are indispensable for the technical operation of the site. They allow for basic navigation, ensure security against threats like Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and manage your consent state. As they are essential, they do not require prior consent, but we inform you of their use for transparency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies:</strong> With your consent, we use Google Analytics cookies to collect aggregated and anonymous data on how visitors interact with our site. They help us understand which pages are most popular, how long users spend in each section, and how we can optimize the structure and content. This data is vital for the continuous improvement of our services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising and Tracking Cookies:</strong> With your consent, we activate cookies from Google AdSense and its partners. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits to display ads that are relevant to your interests. The "sharing" of this information with advertising networks is what allows us to keep this site free. You have full control over this category and can refuse it without any detriment to the site's main functionality.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">4. Legal Basis for Processing and the Importance of Consent</h2>
                <p>Every personal data processing operation we carry out is supported by a valid legal basis, as required by global legislation. Our approach is twofold:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> We process minimal technical data based on our legitimate interest in operating a secure, functional, and protected site against malicious activities. This legal basis is applied only for strictly necessary activities, ensuring that the impact on your privacy is minimal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For all other processing activities, such as performance analysis and personalized advertising, our legal basis is your <strong>explicit, free, and informed consent</strong>. We use a Google-certified Consent Management Platform (CMP) to ensure that your permission is requested clearly and granularly before any non-essential cookies are activated. You can manage or withdraw your consent at any time with the same ease with which you granted it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">5. Purpose of the Calculators and Professional Responsibility</h2>
                <p>It is imperative that all users understand the purpose and limitations of the tools offered. <strong>Nursing Calculators</strong> is a project with a purely <strong>educational and informational</strong> purpose. The tools are designed to assist healthcare professionals and students as a support resource, for quick calculation checks, and for learning purposes. They should not, under any circumstances, be used as the sole source of information for clinical decision-making, diagnoses, or prescribing treatments. Clinical judgment, based on the individual assessment of the patient and professional expertise, is always paramount.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">6. Data Retention and Sharing</h2>
                <p>Our data retention policy is guided by the principle of minimization. The technical and usage data collected are retained only for the time necessary to fulfill the purposes for which they were collected. Google Analytics data, for example, is configured to expire automatically after a set period. We do not sell personal data. Sharing occurs only with essential operational partners, such as Google, for the provision of analytics and advertising services. Any international data transfer is carried out under robust contractual safeguards, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, which ensure a level of data protection equivalent to that of your region of origin.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">7. Information Security</h2>
                <p>We implement a comprehensive set of technical and organizational security measures to protect the processed data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Our measures include, but are not limited to: encryption of all traffic with TLS/SSL, secure development practices, continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities, and a system architecture that minimizes data exposure. Although no system is impenetrable, we are continuously improving our security infrastructure to protect our users' data.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">8. Your Data Protection Rights: A Global Perspective</h2>
                <p>We recognize and respect your rights over your personal data. Below, we detail your rights according to the main legislations.</p>

                <h3 class="font-nunito font-bold text-dark-blue text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-4">8.1. Rights of Data Subjects in the European Union and the United Kingdom (GDPR)</h3>
                <p>If you are in the EEA or the UK, the GDPR grants you the following rights:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>The Right of Access (Article 15):</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and detailed information about the processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Rectification (Article 16):</strong> You have the right to request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Erasure or "Right to be Forgotten" (Article 17):</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Restriction of Processing (Article 18):</strong> You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data in certain situations.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Data Portability (Article 20):</strong> You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and the right to transmit those data to another controller.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Object (Article 21):</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances, including for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making (Article 22):</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="font-nunito font-bold text-dark-blue text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-4">8.2. Consumer Rights in the United States (CCPA/CPRA - California)</h3>
                <p>For California residents, the law grants the following rights:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>The Right to Know:</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Delete:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion of any personal information we have collected from you.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing:</strong> You have the right to direct us not to "sell" or "share" your personal information. In our case, this refers to the sharing of data via cookies for targeted advertising purposes. You can exercise this right by rejecting advertising cookies in our CMP.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong> We ensure that you will not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of your privacy rights.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="font-nunito font-bold text-dark-blue text-xl lg:text-2xl mt-4">8.3. Compliance with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) in Brazil</h3>
                <p>For our users in Brazil, the LGPD (Law No. 13.709/2018) guarantees rights that include confirmation of the existence of the treatment, access to data, correction, anonymization or elimination of unnecessary data, portability, information about sharing, and the revocation of consent.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">9. Commitment to Ethics and Professional Responsibility</h2>
                <p>This project is guided by the ethical principles of the nursing profession, which value life, dignity, and human rights. Transparency in data handling, respect for user autonomy, and a commitment to providing accurate and secure information are direct extensions of these fundamental values. We strongly discourage the use of our tools by laypersons for self-diagnosis or self-medication, reinforcing that consultation with a qualified healthcare professional is indispensable.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>The digital environment and privacy regulations are constantly evolving. Therefore, we reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legislation. All changes will take effect from the "Last updated" date published at the top of this page. We recommend that you review this policy regularly to stay informed.</p>

                <h2 class="font-nunito font-extrabold text-dark-blue text-2xl lg:text-3xl">11. Contact</h2>
